        "# Q1. What is a RESTful API?\n",
        "\n",
        "##  Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "A **RESTful API** (Representational State Transfer API) is a way for two computer systems (like frontend and backend, or two different applications) to communicate over the **HTTP protocol** in a simple, scalable, and stateless manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key points:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **REST (Representational State Transfer)**  \n",
        "   - It's an **architectural style**, not a protocol or standard.  \n",
        "   - Focuses on how resources (like users, products, orders) are represented and accessed.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Resource-based**  \n",
        "   - Everything is treated as a *resource* (e.g., `/users`, `/products/10`).  \n",
        "   - Resources are identified using **URLs (Uniform Resource Locators)**.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Stateless**  \n",
        "   - Each API request contains all the info needed.  \n",
        "   - The server doesn’t store session/state between requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **HTTP Methods** commonly used:  \n",
        "   - **GET** → Read data  \n",
        "   - **POST** → Create data  \n",
        "   - **PUT/PATCH** → Update data  \n",
        "   - **DELETE** → Remove data  \n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Data Format**  \n",
        "   - Most REST APIs use **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**, though XML or plain text can also be used.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "##  Real-world Example\n",

        "\n",
        "- `GET /books` → Fetch list of all books  \n",
        "- `GET /books/1` → Fetch details of book with ID=1  \n",

        "##  Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "An **API Specification** is a detailed document (or file) that defines how an API works, what endpoints it has, what data it accepts, and what it returns.  \n",

        "\n",
        "###  Key Points:\n",
        "1. **Definition**  \n",
        "   - It describes the *structure*, *rules*, and *behaviors* of the API.  \n",
        "   - Ensures both the client (consumer) and server (provider) understand how to communicate.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **What it Contains**  \n",
        "   - **Base URL** → Where the API lives (e.g., `https://api.example.com/`).  \n",
        "   - **Endpoints** → The specific resource paths (e.g., `/users`, `/orders/{id}`).  \n",
        "   - **HTTP Methods** → Allowed actions (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).  \n",
        "   - **Request Parameters** → Query strings, headers, or body data.  \n",
        "   - **Response Format** → JSON/XML schemas, status codes, error messages.  \n",
        "   - **Authentication Rules** → API keys, OAuth tokens, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Purpose**  \n",
        "   - Acts as a **guidebook** for developers.  \n",

        "In Flask, the **`session` object** is used to **store information about a user across multiple requests**.  \n",
        "It allows your application to **remember data between different pages** for a particular client, similar to **cookies**, but stored securely on the server-side (signed using a secret key).\n",
